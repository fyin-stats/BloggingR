I'm a data & applied scientist / statistician in CSX data science team at Microsoft. Our team provides statistics and machine learning expertise to support all Windows features and products. 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of California, Irvine in 2020 (supervised by Prof. Carter T. Butts), and my B.S. in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China in 2014. I previously worked at Moody's Analytics (2017), Uber (2019) as summer intern.

My research interests lie on social network analysis, computational statistics, Bayesian analysis, Responsible AI (differential privacy, fairness in machine learning).

I look forward to collaborations and peer review opportunities. Feel free to contact me via email (fyin.andrew@gmail.com).
