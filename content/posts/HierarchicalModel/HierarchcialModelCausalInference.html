<p>When should we use hierarchical model for causal inference? This question has bothered me for years. Thanks to this technical report (<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/HierarchicalCausal.pdf" class="uri">http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/HierarchicalCausal.pdf</a>) by Avi Feller and Andrew Gelman, this question became less mysterious to me.</p>
<p>According to their explanantion, the hierarchical model can aid causal inference when dealing with the following problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Accouting for data collection: we need to account for any individual of group charateristics that are predictive of treatment assignment or group characteristics that are predictive of treatment assignment and inclusion in the dataset.</li>
<li>Adjusting for unmeasured covariates: In observation studies, it is necessary to adjust for differences between treated and control items.</li>
<li>Modeling variation in treatment effects: sometimes we are not only interested in the average treatment effect but also in how the effect varies across the population.</li>
</ul>

<p>Random assignment depends on one or more observed covariates, for example, treatment is randomly assigned to half men and half women in a study population.</p>
