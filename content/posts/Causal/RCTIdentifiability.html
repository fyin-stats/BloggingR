<p>In this blog, I shall summarize my learning about why and how we are able to identify the average treatment effect from randomized clinical trials (RCT).</p>
<p>Under the potential outcome framework , we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> i.i.d samples <span class="math inline">\((X_{i}, W_{i}, Y_{i}(1), Y_{i}(0)) \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \{0, 1\} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\)</span>, with the individual causal effect being defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \Delta_{i} \equiv Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i}(1)\)</span> denotes the outcome of individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>  it were to receive the treatment, <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i}(0)\)</span> denotes the outcome of individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>  it were NOT to receive the treatment. Here, we focus on the scenario under which each individual either receives or not receives the treatment (<span class="math inline">\(W_{i} = 0, 1\)</span>), and also assume that the treatment is stable across individuals and the individuals do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>The fundamental challenge here is that we have a missing data problem, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{i}\)</span> is never observed, though we might imagine a  world where everything is the same except the cause. The implication here is that we cannot estimate the individual causal effect of the treatment, but we might hope to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tau \equiv \mathbb{E}[\Delta_{i}] = \mathbb[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)] \]</span></p>
<p>Under randomized controlled trials (RCT), we have the following assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency: <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i} = W_{i} Y_{i}(1) + (1 - W_{i}) Y_{i}(0)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Random treatment assignment: <span class="math inline">\(W_{i}\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\((Y_{i}(1), Y_{i}(0), X_{i})\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>therefore, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tau \equiv \mathbb{E}[\Delta_{i}] = \mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)] \stackrel{(1)}{=} \mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(1) | W_{i} = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{i}(0) | W_{i} = 0] \stackrel{(2)}{=} \mathbb{E}[Y_{i} | W_{i} = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{i} | W_{i} = 0] \]</span></p>
<p>where (1) is based on the assumption of random treatment assignment, and (2) is based on the assumption of consistency. Therefore, we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> by the estimator below</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{n_{1}} \sum_{W_{i}=1} Y_{i} -  \frac{1}{n_{0}} \sum_{W_{i}=0} Y_{i}\]</span></p>
