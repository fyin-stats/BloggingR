<p>A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successively equally spaced points in time. Forecasting is about predicting the future (an event of a trend) and as far I am concerned, statistical forecasting implies the use of statistics based on historical data to project what could happen in the future (e.g., sales, GDP, housing prices, etc.).</p>

<h2>Some Common Forecasting Problems</h2>
<p>We list some common forecasting problems in the table below and we examine them on the various aspects, including,
* Data size and people running the analysis
* Forecasting horizon
* Time granularity
* Cadence of forecast
* Human interaction
* Other notes</p>
