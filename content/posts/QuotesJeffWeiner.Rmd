I came across a video titled "LinkedIn CEO Shares Advice On Leadership, Hiring and Firing" on YouTube. I found the first part of Jeff Weiner's interview was full of insightful quotes about life in general, and I'd like to take notes here.

## Five keys to happiness
* To live in the moment
* To be a spectator of your own thoughts, especially when you become emotional
* Better to be loving rather than to be right
* To be grateful for at least one thing everyday
* To be of service to others and help others every chance you get

## Compassion and wisdom
Wisdom without compassion is ruthless, compassion without wisdom is folly.
