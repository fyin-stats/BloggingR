<div id="five-keys-to-happiness" class="section level2">
<h2>Five keys to happiness</h2>
<ul>
<li>To live in the moment</li>
<li>To be a spectator of your own thoughts, especially when you become emotional</li>
<li>Better to be loving rather than to be right</li>
<li>To be grateful for at least one thing everyday</li>
<li>To be of service to others and help others every chance you get</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="compassion-and-wisdom" class="section level2">
<h2>Compassion and wisdom</h2>
<p>Wisdom without compassion is ruthless, compassion without wisdom is folly.</p>
</div>
